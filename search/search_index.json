If the model preformence is poor then it must have overfitted the training set. if it preforms well on the train-dev we cant try evalute it on the dev set.  </p> <p>Dev set(validation): This is the set used during develompent to choose the best model or hpyerparameters we want to use and it give an estamation of how well will the model work on unseen but representive data.</p> <p>Test set: The final evaluation of the model, it's used to estimate how well the modell will preform on real world data we evaluate it once at the end and thats it.
